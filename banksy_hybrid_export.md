# Banksy Project Development Log (Hybrid Export)

## Overview
This document is a **hybrid export** of the Banksy MVP project conversation.  
It contains two major parts:
1. **Professional Summary** – A polished overview of the phases, decisions, and results.
2. **Raw Transcript Appendices** – Verbatim logs of the conversation for full transparency.

---

# Part 1: Professional Summary

## Backend Development
- **Frameworks**: FastAPI, SQLAlchemy (async), Alembic for migrations, SQLite (dev), PostgreSQL (prod).
- **Features Implemented**:
  - Authentication integration with Clerk.
  - Core models: `User`, `Account`, `Transaction`.
  - Extensions: `AccountHolder`, `Card`, `MoneyTransfer`, `ErrorLogger`.
  - Middleware for error logging with DB persistence.
  - Statement generation from transaction history (dynamic, no extra model).
- **Key Decisions**:
  - `AccountHolder` as join-table for flexible account ownership types.
  - `MoneyTransfer` creates **two Transactions** (debit & credit).
  - Positive-only `Transaction.amount` with logic to adjust for DEBIT vs CREDIT.

## Testing
- **Framework**: Pytest + pytest-asyncio.
- **Fixtures**:
  - In-memory SQLite database for isolation.
  - `authorized_client` mocking Clerk JWTs.
  - Auto-cleanup between tests.
- **Coverage**: ~65% at MVP (goal 80%+).
- **Highlights**:
  - End-to-end error logging tests (raise exception → DB log entry).
  - Transaction ownership checks.
  - Account creation auto-assigns `PRIMARY` holder.
  - Statement generation verified with credit/debit adjustments.

## Frontend Development
- **Framework**: Next.js 15 + React 19 + TailwindCSS v4.
- **Features**:
  - Dashboard with user profile + active accounts.
  - Accounts page (create, view, link to transactions).
  - Transactions page (view, create new).
  - Money Transfer page (sender/recipient accounts, double-entry).
  - Error Reporting page (stacktrace trimmed to 5 lines).
  - Account Holders management (add/remove, role types).
  - Statements view (dynamic by date range).
  - Cards (ship new card, digital card UI).
- **UI/UX**:
  - Neon-inspired palette for modern banking feel (inspired by Robinhood).
  - Transaction rows alternate light/dark shading.
  - Suspense boundaries fixed for useSearchParams issues.

## Dockerization
- **Multi-stage builds** for backend & frontend.
- Issues encountered & solved:
  - `.next` not copied → fixed by proper `COPY --from=builder`.
  - `pnpm-lock.yaml` mismatch → aligned lockfiles in root/frontend.
  - `.env` handling → moved from `COPY` into `Makefile`-driven `--env-file` injection.
  - DB persistence: mounted `./data` for prod, tmpfs for dev/test.
- **Makefile Targets**:
  - `make dev` → dev docker-compose.
  - `make up` → prod docker-compose.
  - `make db-rev`, `make db-upgrade`, `make seed` helpers.

## Final Polish
- **Docs**:
  - `README.md`: project overview, run instructions, env vars, Docker usage.
  - `ONBOARDING.md`: step-by-step setup guide for new developers.
- **Styling**:
  - Tailwind global.css refined with neon palette, alternating row backgrounds.
  - Calendar/date input restyled for visibility.
- **Testing (Frontend)**:
  - Vitest + React Testing Library + JSDOM.
  - Clerk + API fully mocked for isolated tests.

# Part 2: Raw Transcript Appendices

Below is the verbatim log of the entire conversation between Developer (user) and AI (assistant).  
For brevity in this export, only **sample excerpts** are included – the full transcript is available separately.

---

## Appendix A – Backend Build & Models
```plaintext
[user]: Amazing suggestions, that works! Let's move on to the next step
[assistant]: Great, next we’ll add a transaction create endpoint + UI…
[user]: Nice, I just needed to complete step 1 and that resolved my issue...
...
```

## Appendix B – Testing & Fixtures
```plaintext
[user]: When running the tests with `poetry run pytest -v` I receive this error...
[assistant]: That means pytest cannot resolve the `app` module, let’s fix sys.path in conftest.py...
[user]: Ok I changed some things so now the basic test is passing...
...
```

## Appendix C – Frontend UI/UX
```plaintext
[user]: ok this looks better. The view transactions button is not working properly...
[assistant]: Let’s scaffold a dedicated /accounts/[id] detail page…
[user]: Wow, amazing we went from nothing just a few days ago to a full fledged MVP...
...
```

## Appendix D – Dockerization Issues
```plaintext
[user]: The docker file is still not working for the frontend application...
[assistant]: Try adjusting COPY paths, remember pnpm-lock.yaml location matters...
[user]: Amazing job, together we resolved all the docker issues...
...
```
